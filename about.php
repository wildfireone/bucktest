        <h2>About BASC</h2>

        <h3>History</h3>

        <p>Bucksburn Amateur Swimming Club (BASC) is a fairly young club with over 100 swimmers, which hosts a wide range of age groups and abilities. BASC was formed in 1990, and at that time had only 1 core aim - to encourage local participation in the sport of swimming.</p>

                <p>In 1996, Bucksburn, along with 6 other local clubs, Aberdeen City Council, The Scottish Swimming Association, and The Scottish Sports Council pulled together to form 'City of Aberdeen Swim Team' (C.O.A.S.T). C.O.A.S.T was founded in order to achieve 2 core aims:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>To produce a swimming team which can compete with success at UK level.    </li>
            <li>To provide a clear performance pathway for all swimmers to reach and fulfil their maximum potential.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Our Club</h3>

        <p>The consequence of affiliating to C.O.A.S.T meant that BASC had to adopt more defined and ambitious aims. BASC now has 2 core aims:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>To provide a swimming club which can produce swimmers to attain C.O.A.S.T standards and compete at North District level and above.</li>
                <li>To provide a pathway enabling swimmers to achieve the best of their ability - competitive and non-competitive.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>We boast that we are a friendly club catering for both social and competitive swimmers. No child is ever put under pressure to compete, but those that do are given every opportunity. We will encourage every child as an individual to achieve to the best of their ability, and go as far as they are capably possible.</p>

            <p>At present we have 9 squads, 9 coaches, and 4 pool-helpers. We are always trying to encourage parents to become more involved, whether on pool-side, committee members, timekeepers, or an extra pair of hands to help out on the night!</p>

            <p>At BASC the committee believes that the proceeds of fundraising events should be given back to the children. In 2003 our fundraising efforts provided club tracksuits at a generously discounted price, which is really impressive when worn at events. As you can imagine it also boosts team spirit.</p>

            <p>We also try and create a team spirit out-with the swimming pool to encourage bonding, this is done in the form of social outings or activities, usually in the form of disco's, bowling nights and picnics. Social outings and activities are usually arranged to involve the whole family and not just the swimmer, therefore allowing the whole family to meet and bond with new friends.</p>

            <p>If you would like more information and feel that you would like to be a member of our team and meet new friends, please feel free to contact any of the committee members. Please click here to read about the joining information.</p>
